# Diamond_League_Project

## Project Overview

**What I Have Done So Far***
- I wrote a script that downloads Results PDFs from the Diamond League website
- It runs through all of the Diamond League locations from this year's season and grabs PDFs of the results

**What I Plan On Adding in the Near Future**
- I plan on scaling this to get results from previous years and handle results from the following years
- I am going to create a script that parses the PDFs and turns the data into data frames and output to parquet
- I am going to put the unstructured data into an AWS S3 bucket and structured data into an AWS RDS database

**Goal**
- My goal for this project is to build a model that forecasts likelihood of who wins the next race based on their previous performances
